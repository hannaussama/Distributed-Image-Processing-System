# Distributed-Image-Processing-System
This project aims to develop a distributed image processing system using cloud computing technologies. The system will be implemented in Python, leveraging cloud-based virtual machines for distributed computing. The application will use MPI for parallel processing of image data.

# Features and Specifications
-Distributed Processing: The system should be able to distribute image processing tasks across multiple virtual machines in the cloud.

-Image Processing Algorithms: Implement various image processing algorithms such as filtering, edge detection, and color manipulation.

-Scalability: The system should be scalable, allowing for the addition of more virtual machines as the workload increases.

-Fault Tolerance: The system should be resilient to failures, with the ability to reassign tasks from failed nodes to operational ones.

# Usage
1)Configure cloud-based virtual machines for distributed computing.

2)Run the main application script: 
      python gui.py
      
3)Follow the prompts to upload an image, select processing operation, and monitor progress.

4)Once processing is complete, download the processed image.
